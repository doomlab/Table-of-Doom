Abstract
In the era of big data, psycholinguistic research is flourishing with numerous publications that advance our knowledge of concept characteristics and ways to study them. This article presents the Linguistic Annotated Bibliography (LAB) as a searchable web portal to quickly and easily access reliable database norms, related programs, and variable calculations. These publications were coded by language, number of stimuli, stimuli type (i.e., words, pictures, symbols), keywords (i.e., frequency, semantics, valence), and other useful information. This tool not only allows researchers to search for the specific type of stimuli needed for experiments, but also permits the exploration of publication trends across 100 years of research. Details about the portal creation and use are outlined, as well as various analyses of change in publication rates and keywords. In general, advances in computation power have allowed for the increase in dataset size in the recent decades, in addition to an increase in the number of linguistic variables provided in each publication.

You can also find more information about our Shiny apps on the associated GitHub Page: https://github.com/doomlab/shiny-server. We will update the LAB database on that page to keep the manuscript information separated from the updated dataset. We want to keep this page for the manuscript so that the published version is reproducible with this repository, while updating our tool on the server page for new use. You can cite the manuscript and the database separately. Use the OSF page to cite the manuscript (publication coming soon hopefully!), and use the citation information on the app page for the current version of the LAB database.
